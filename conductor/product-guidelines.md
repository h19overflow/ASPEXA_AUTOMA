# Product Guidelines: Aspexa Automa

## Tone and Voice
The primary tone of Aspexa Automa is **Professional and Authoritative**. We communicate expertise in cybersecurity with precision, clarity, and objectivity. Our voice should inspire confidence in the system's analysis and recommendations.

## Communication Principles
- **Clarity over Complexity**: Use precise terminology but explain complex security concepts clearly.
- **Evidence-Based Findings**: Every security claim must be supported by detailed evidence, including logs and logical reasoning.
- **Action-Oriented Reporting**: Don't just report a problem; provide clear, actionable steps for remediation.
- **Standardized Risk Assessment**: Use industry-standard severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical) to communicate impact consistently.

## Visual and Branding Identity
The project follows a **Clean, Minimalist, and Cybersecurity-focused** aesthetic.
- **Clarity and Readability**: Prioritize information hierarchy and data clarity.
- **Technical Aesthetic**: Use themes and fonts that resonate with security professionals (e.g., dark modes, monospace fonts for logs/code).
- **Consistency**: Maintain a unified look across the CLI, reports, and documentation.

## User Engagement and Community
- **Transparent Development**: Use public roadmaps and structured issue tracking to keep the community informed.
- **Collaborative Growth**: Encourage and simplify community contributions through clear guidelines and a welcoming environment.
- **Responsive Feedback**: Actively listen to user feedback and use it to drive project improvements.

## Documentation Standards
- **Exhaustive Coverage**: Document every feature, configuration setting, and architectural decision.
- **Example-Driven**: Use clear, real-world examples to demonstrate how to use the framework effectively.
- **Logical Structure**: Organize documentation logically to make it easy for users to find what they need.
